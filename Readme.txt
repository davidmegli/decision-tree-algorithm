Welcome to Decision Tree Classifier by David Megli,
This program uses the UCI Machine Learning Repository to fetch datasets and train a decision tree classifier using k-fold cross validation.
To utilize the algorithm 
To use the algorithm, simply run main.py, choose a dataset from the list (or any other from the UCI Machine Learning Repository by entering its id), and enter the value corresponding to the number of folds desired for the kâ€“fold cross validation stratified.
The program prints the list of classes and predictions on the screen, highlighting the errors in red, and reporting for each fold the number of errors committed and the relative errors.
